Nothing should be ignored in this case, as the changes only include:
- Added: firebase_sync_logic.md (documentation file)
- Deleted: GoogleSignInButton.kt (source code file)
- Modified: README.md (documentation file)

These are all source/documentation files without any build artifacts, dependencies, or temporary files that would require gitignore entries.
